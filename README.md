# SONG DATABASE SYSTEM WITH THEME AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

#### Created by Indira Faisa Afgani for the 1st Capstone Project - Data Science and Machine Learning Program

## Project Background
Music is often associated with emotions, personal experiences, and social themes. Nowadays, many song database systems are created to store, manage, and retrieve music data, which includes song titles, artists, albums, genres, durations, and release years.

This project was developed to simulate a mini song management system that not only stores song data but also categorizes them by themes. This program also allows the user to assign sentiment scores based on their analysis of the song. This project aims to demonstrate basic fundamental programming concepts, such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), data validations, and data management using Python.

## Problem
Manually managing song data can lead to:
1. Limited ability to efficiently maintain and update data
2. Difficulty in searching for a specific song
3. No emotional and thematic categorization

## Target Users
This program is designed for:
1. Music analysts or enthusiast who are interested in organizing songs based on emotional attributes
2. Students exploring theme-based and sentiment-based categorization

## Program Overview
This program, which was built by using Python 3, allows the user to store and manage song data. Furthermore, they can also add, update, and delete the database based on their preferences. For this program, the database’s table was designed and constructed with Tabulate Library. This program also includes a sentiment scoring feature ranging from -2 (very negative) to +2 (very positive).

## The Features
These are some of the main features that can be accessed by the user:
1. View song database in tabulate format
2. Search song by ID from the database
3. Search song by choosing categories
4. Add new song data
5. Update song details
6. Delete song from database

## How To Use The Program
1. Make sure you have already installed Python 3 on your system
2. Installed the required library 
    ```bash 
    pip install tabulate
    ```
3. Run the program 
    ```bash 
    Capstone Project 1.py
    ```
